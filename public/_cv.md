### Skills

* **Front-end** \
My specialty is the "backend of the frontend". I use modern browser APIs in maintainable, modular and well-tested TypeScript and current JavaScript to collect, store and expose data by consuming or creating APIs and data structures. I enjoy doing code reviews and gate-keeping projects from dependency creep. I've got a working experience using reactive frameworks – React, Vue and Svelte.

* **Back-end** \
Node.js is my go-to tool for writing scripts and build tools for data transformation and processing, creating custom build processes, designing REST/GraphQL API servers and connecting to the rest of the backend infrastructure. I've previously used recent PHP frameworks and MySQL to build websites.

* **DevOps** \
I write my own Docker images and compose definitions for most projects to unify development environments and to get apps ready for cloud deployment in container orchestration services. I'm comfortable using GitLab for setting up CI/CD workflows and deployment to Kubernetes.
