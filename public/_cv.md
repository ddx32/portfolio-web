### Summary

### Skills

* **Front-end code**  
	I deliver work that is **responsive**, lightweight and pushing the limits of what's implemented in browsers while staying cross-browser friendly.  
	I'm a daily user of jQuery & trying to favor vanilla JS wherever possible. **SASS, LESS, NPM and Gulp** help me with code organization, package management and optimized delivery.

* **Design**  
	My experience covers the complete design process from **sketches** and **wireframes** to iteration of high fidelity prototypes based on client feedback through **InVision**.  
	I switched to **Sketch** + Affinity Designer after >10 years of Photoshop.

* **Back-end**  
	I've deployed back-end code that adheres to the principles of MVC, OOP and DRY.  
	My background is in PHP & MySQL – I have years of experience using **Wordpress API** and **Nette Framework** creating both simple and complex sites.
