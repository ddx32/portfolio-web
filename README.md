# Filip Růžička
## filthy snake & debugging weasel

This is my personal website/portfolio. See it in action at [filipruzicka.com](https://filipruzicka.com).

Built with [Harp](https://github.com/sintaxi/harp) and some custom build functionality via [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp). PDFs get compiled with [markdown-pdf](https://github.com/alanshaw/markdown-pdf).

Just `npm install && npm run build` to compile static site.

Site is deployed continuously from this repo via [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
