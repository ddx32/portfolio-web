# Filip Ruzicka - a filthy snake

This is my personal website/portfolio. Compiled version should be up at [filipruzicka.com](https://filipruzicka.com).

I built it mostly with [Harp](https://github.com/sintaxi/harp) with some custom build functionality via [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp). Inspired heavily by [harp-gulp-browsersync-boilerplate](https://github.com/superhighfives/harp-gulp-browsersync-boilerplate) PDFs get compiled with [markdown-pdf](https://github.com/alanshaw/markdown-pdf).

Just `npm install` to setup, run `gulp` for live server, `gulp compile` to compile static site.
